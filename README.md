- Types of Planes
- Packet Switching


### Type of Plane

**Management Plane** 
- Purpose: Use to manage, monitor and configure the devices
- Traffic Type: Administrative taffic between a network administrator and devices
- Example: SSH/Telnet, SNMP, Syslog, NTP
- Handled by: CPU

**Control Plane**
- Purpose: Responsible for building and maintiaining routing and switching table - it's the brain of device
- Traffic type: A traffic generated by a device for another device.
- Example: Routing Protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, BGP), STP, ARP, CDP, LLDP
- Updates tables used by Data Plane
- Handled by: CPU

**Data Plane**
- Purpose: Actually forwards user data packets based on the information built by control plane.
- Traffic type: Real user / Application Traffic
- Example: Forwarding packets using rounting table / MAC address table, QoS marking, ACL filtering, NAT translationn
- Handled by: ASIC's (hardware chip designed to perform a specific set of tasks very efficiently)

### Packet Switching 
- When a router recive a packet on ingress interface, it decides the appropriate egress interface to forward that packet â€” this process is called packet switching
- Which is impacted by Control Plane & Data Plane 

Types of Packet Switching:

**Process Switching**
- Refer to method where the router's CPU is directly involved in decision making process of switching
